Who is ProbablyKam?
===================
Well to put it in an image, because an image speaks a thousand words, this.  

![artistic interpretation of me](/assets/kam.svg)  

Put into words, its me. My name is kam (not to ever once in a billion years be associated with KAM) and i like coding, video games, and helping my fellow students have unblocked games in class! I am also the creator and leader of [The Sour Patch Kids](https://sourpatchclub.netlify.app/).  

The main languages I know are HTML, CSS, Lua and I'm trying to learn more, hopefully as many as I can!
